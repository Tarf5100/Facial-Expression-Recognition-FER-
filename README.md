# Facial-Expression-Recognition-FER-
Developed a deep learning–based Facial Expression Recognition (FER) system using the FER-2013 dataset. Implemented and compared multiple models including a baseline NN, CNN, enhanced CNN, and fine-tuned VGG-16. The enhanced CNN achieved the best validation accuracy with strong generalization.
